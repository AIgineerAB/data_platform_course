## Windows

1. We'll start with installing Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), which is a Open up powershell and type

```bash
wsl --install
```

2. Restart computer and then wsl.exe will download ubuntu.

> [!NOTE]
> it might say something like this
>
> ```
> WslRegisterDistribution failed with error: 0x80370102
>Please enable the Virtual Machine Platform Windows feature and ensure virtualization is enabled in the BIOS.
> ```
>
> this means that you need to go into BIOS settings and enable virtualization in order for windows to be able to have virtual machine natively, which ubuntu is in this case  

1. [download and install docker desktop on windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/)

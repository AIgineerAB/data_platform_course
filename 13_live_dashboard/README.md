In this lecture we'll build a pipeline that ends up with serving a live dashboard in streamlit. This is a continuation fo 10_postgres_sink, so most of the files are the same as in lecture 10.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> add kafka_data and state to your .gitignore as we bind mount this folder into kafka broker, in order to persist data in the topics.
